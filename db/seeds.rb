    2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 3/4 cup chocolate chips/chopped chocolate, Flaky salt, for sprinkling (optional)", method: "1. Preheat oven to 350 F. Line an 8 inch square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving some excess hanging over for easy removal later. 

    2. In a large bowl, stir together the tahini and coconut sugar until smooth. Add in the eggs, vanilla extract, and salt and mix vigorously until mixture is smooth again. Stir in chocolate chips/chunks last.
    
    3. Spread batter into prepared baking pan evenly. Sprinkle more chocolate chips on top of batter if desired. Sprinkle flaky salt over batter if using. 
    
    4. Bake blondies for 23-27 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of the blondies comes out with a few gooey crumbs. Don't over-bake! Let blondies cool before lifting from pan and slicing into 16-20 squares.")

    Coarse salt, for sprinkling (optional)", method: "Preheat oven to 350 F. Line a baking sheet (you may want to use two sheets, the cookies spread quite a bit) with parchment paper.

    In a large bowl, stir together the tahini and coconut sugar until mixture is smooth.
    
    Stir in the egg, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt. Be careful not to over-mix or oils from tahini will come out and make cookies spread too much. Add in chopped chocolate last. 
    
    Round tablespoons of dough between palms and place onto sheets. Don't flatten. Sprinkle a little flaky salt on top of each cookie if desired. 
    
    Bake cookies for 10 minutes, or until edges are golden. Let cookies rest on sheet for 10 minutes to firm up before moving them.")

    2 teaspoons of crumbled feta,
    2 teaspoons of pine nuts,
    pepper", method: "In a small bowl mix the tahini with the water and lemon juice, the consistency should not be too thick (thinner than peanut butter). It should be easy to spread. If need add a bit more water.
    Toast the bread.
    Remove bread from toaster, spread a thick layer of the tahini dip, sprinkle with feta and pine nuts.
    Add pepper.")

    Meanwhile prepare the tahini dressing. Combine tahini, lemon juice, water, and a garlic clove in a food processor (mini food processor works well), pulse until smooth and pourable consistency. Add one extra tablespoon or two, if needed to reach desired consistency.")
